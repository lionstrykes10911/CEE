# NPC (Nuke's Player Customizer)

Nuke's Player Customizer (Thanks Juni for the name.), is a yet to be made a spiritual successor of CapsAdmin's/Pengu's PAC, as I think it's about time for a new rewrite for it.
This in not to compete with PAC, but to try and have a more stable, optimized and less performance heavy version of it.
This probably won't have stuff for a good while until I get actual proper time to do stuff.
