# CEE (Catalyst Entity Editor)

Catalyst Entity Editor, is a yet to be made spiritual successor of CapsAdmin's/Pengu's PAC, as I think it's about time for a new rewrite for it.
<br/> This in not to compete with PAC, but to try and have a more stable, optimized and less performance heavy version of it.
<br/> This probably won't have stuff for a good while until I get actual proper time to do stuff.

Note to self for later parts (Based on priority):
<br/> -Keep the editor less cluttered;
<br/> -StringStream library + lzma compressing for storing files (Idea by Bonyoze);
<br/> -Proxy expression text editor;
<br/> -Folder parts;
<br/> -Wiki;
<br/> -Projectile types (rocket, splash potion);
